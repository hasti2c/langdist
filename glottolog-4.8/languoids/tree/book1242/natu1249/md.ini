comment = There are three related languages on the island of Santa Cruz and it is
	confusing to refer to only one (which is actually two if this application is
	accepted) of them as "Santa Cruz."
	
	* Speakers of both varieties have to learn the other one.
	
	* There is no common written literature; oral society with stories told in own
	variety.
	
	* They consider themselves to speak different languages for census purposes.
	
	
	The linguistics literature refers to all three languages on the island of Santa
	Cruz as Santa Cruz languages, when speaking of the Reefs-Santa Cruz languages
	(RSC). But it also refers to Natügu and Nalögo as "N. and S. Santa Cruz," and
	Nanggu (Nagu) with its own name. Therefore, Santa Cruz is better reserved as the
	genetic group containing all three of these languages.
