comment = It was discovered that the Ethnologue entries for India_Miju Mishmi_mxj and
	China_Geman Deng_gen are referring to the same language. Gaman Deng is an
	alternate name for mxj. Kuman is an alternate name for Geman Deng and Kaman is
	an alternate name for Miju Mishmi. The locations for each language are just
	across the India/China border from each other. they are both classified in the
	North Assam branch of the Sino-Tibetan language tree. It is proposed that the
	name Geman Deng be retained for China (and Myanmar) but assume the same language
	code as Miju Mishmi, with India being the HUB country for the language.
