comment = Omati is the name of a village, and not the name of a language, so the name
	Omati should be replaced by the two new names: Mouwase and Barikewa. Although
	reports indicate that there is some mutual intelligibility between speakers of
	the Mouwase and Barikewa languages, speakers of these languages see themselves
	as having distinct linguistic identities. They recognize that both languages are
	part of the "Kaser" subgroup, but still identify Mouwase and Barikewa as
	separate varieties. Lexicostatistics confirms their status as separate
	languages, as there is only 38% lexical similarity between them.
