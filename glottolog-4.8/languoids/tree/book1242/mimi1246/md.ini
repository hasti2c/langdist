comment = During a sociolinguistic survey in November 2004 we visited the people group
	known in Chad as Mimi. They call themselves Amdang and their language Amdangti.
	There was no evidence of other Mimi populations and other Mimi dialects. The
	population figure of both Mimi and Amdang as recorded in the Ethnologue 15th ed.
	is roughly 40,000, but these appear to be the same 40,000. I suggest collapsing
	the entries for amj and miv into amj, thus calling the Mimi language of Chad
	"Amdang".
