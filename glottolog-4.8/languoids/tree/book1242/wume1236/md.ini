comment = Wumeng and Wusa have long been recognized as distinct varieties of Nasu, but
	Wumeng is spoken primarily in Guizhou Province with some speakers also living in
	Yunnan Province (thus matching the [ywu] profile), and Wusa is spoken only in
	Guizhou Province (thus matching the [yig] profile). The Ethnologue profile
	associated with [ywm], however, claims that the language is spoken only in
	Yunnan. The confusion, then, can likely be traced back to a lack of
	understanding regarding a single variety spoken on both sides of a provincial
	line. Thus, [ywm] should be merged into [ywu], the [ywu] reference name should
	be changed to reflect the Wumeng distinction, and the [yig] reference name
	should be changed to reflect the Wusa distinction (cf. the related [ywu] and
	[yig] reference name change applications).
