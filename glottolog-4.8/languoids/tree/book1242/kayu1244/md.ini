comment = There are various lects belonging to the closely-related Lampung(ic) language
	family scattered throughout the Sumatran provinces of Lampung and South Sumatra.
	The term "Lampung" applies to the whole family (or the province); however the
	language family (formerly consisting of 9 Ethnologue entries) is best conceived
	as consisting of three closely-related languages: Lampung Api, Lampung Nyo and
	Komering (see Hanawalt et al. forthcoming for more details). The northernmost
	area of this family follows the Komering river. Phonologically it is quite
	similar to Lampung Api but in terms of lexicon and ethnolinguistic identity (as
	well as exposure which leads to familiarity) it is quite distinct. The Komering
	area furthest downstream is the city of Kayu Agung. There are not one but two
	speech varieties in Kayu Agung, one just called "Kayu Agung" and one called
	"Kayu Agung Asli" or "native Kayu Agung". The latter consists of one village
	within the city. Oral tradition has it that the numerically dominant "Kayu
	Agung" is actually from somewhere in Lampung, and there are well-known but minor
	differences between the two in terms of lexicon and phonology, with no
	disruption of intelligibility. The two lects also share a high degree of
	linguistic coherence and intelligibility with Komering varieties further
	upstream and should not be termed different languages.
