[iso_retirement]
comment = The language code element for Kunfal [xuf] should be retired, and Kunfal should
	be merged with Awngi [awn]. Kunfal has been shown to be a dialect of Awngi,
	according to the results of two survey trips undertaken by Andreas Joswig,
	Hussein Mohammed and Ryan Boone in 2005 (to be published). Comprehension testing
	results and interview data regarding language attitude and identity all support
	this conclusion. Speakers of the Kunfal variety can understand Awngi texts with
	no problem and identify it as their own language.
