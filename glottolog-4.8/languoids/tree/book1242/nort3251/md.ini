comment = Northern Nambikaura is a language cluster, not an individual language. The
	speech varieties listed as dialects of Northern Nambikuara [mbg] have been
	determined to be several separate but closely related languages / language
	dialect groups. Northern Nambikuara [mbg] should be changed from a language name
	to a part of the classification of the Nambiquaran languages.
	
	For the classification of Nambiquaran languages, there should now be a
	distinction made between a Northern cluster and a Southern cluster. Currently
	there is only a distinction between two language groups Northern Nambikuara
	[mbg] and Southern Nambikaura [nab]. They are both listed in the Ethnologue as
	"Class: Nambiquaran". I am recommending that the Northern Nambikuara [mbg]
	language be split into potentially 6 separate languages / language dialect
	groups and that these 6 will receive new ISO language identity codes and should
	be classified as "Class: Nambiquaran, Northern". The Southern Nambikuara [nab]
	language should then be classified as "Class: Nambiquaran, Southern". The [nab]
	language has several dialects listed. These may be split into separate languages
	/ language dialect groups at a later time. More research is needed before this
	can be done.
	
	Intelligibilty testing and interviews indicate that the dialects listed for this
	language, Northern Nambikuara [mbg], are actually separate languages / language
	dialect groups. These finding are also supported by ethnololinguistic identity
	as speakers of these separate languages do not view themselves as a single
	ethnic group, but rather as at least 8 separate ethnic groups with at least 6
	separate languages being spoken by these 8 ethnic groups.
