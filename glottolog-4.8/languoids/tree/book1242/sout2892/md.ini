comment = Taguchi, who originally stated that they are differen langauges, recently sent
	me an e-mail stating the following "My survey report in 1996-7 concluded that
	the North and South Wemale should be identified as two different languages.
	However, after many years of interactions of Wemale community people I learned
	and can now conclude that they can communicate with each other without
	difficulty. So now we may want to say that Wemale have at least two main
	dialects: North and South Dialects."
	
	I recently returned from a survey of North Wemale and they said that they have
	no problem communicating with the Wemale on the south coast of Seram.
