comment = The Rohingya people claim to be indigenous to Rakhine State of Myanmar. They
	claim descent from Arab traders who settled on the coast well over 1,000 years
	ago and their local Muslim converts, and were the ruling class of the ancient
	Kingdom of Arakan which until the mid 18th century covered part of Bangladesh's
	Chittagong Division as well as Rakhine State. Proof of their long presence in
	Myanmar is found in the ruins of many ancient mosques in Rakhine State, some
	over 500 years old. The Myanmar government, however, claims that the Rohingya
	are recent immigrants from Bangladesh, and has suppressed their language and
	attempted to drive the entire population to Bangladesh whose government has not
	accepted them. The language is Indo-Aryan, with an admixture of Persian, Arabic
	and some Burmese vocabulary. Tonal distinctions exist, a feature of Burmese but
	not usual in Indo-Aryan languages. Rohingya is closely related to but distinct
	from Chittagonian, which is reported to be understood by most men but not by
	most women.
