comment = In my 2004 Dogon survey report I wrote: "According to the elders of the Mombo
	speaking village Bandiougou, Ampari-kora speakers could understand them, but not
	vice-versa. One explanation might be inherent intelligibility, since
	Calame-Griaule listed both Mombo and Ampari-kora (she called it Ãmbaŋge) as
	subvarieties of Edyeŋge dõ. However, since the Ampari-kora speakers that the
	elders spoke about came yearly to Bandiougou to observe a rite, this might also
	be learned comprehension."
	
	In 2009 I analysed the following Dogon wordlists in Wordsurv 6.0.2: Miambo de
	Makou, Mombo de Bandiougou, Mombo Kɔlu Sɔ, Mombo de Kori-Kori, Mombo Pignari,
	Nyambaleeŋge de Ficko, Mombo (Blench's Ambaleenge) de Kema, and Ampari de
	Pahandaga, Ampari de Pa, Ampari de Danga, Ampari de Baboye. Raw scores between
	Mombo varieties range from 71-88%. Raw scores between Ampari varieties range
	from 70- 88%. Raw scores between Mombo and Ampari varieties range from 40-53%.
	Total number of items compared range from 64 to 180.
	
	"...Mombo and Ampari are separate non-intercomprehensible varieties, which,
	however, are genetically much closer to each other than to any other Dogon
	language." (correspondence with Prokhorov 12-19-2009)
