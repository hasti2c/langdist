comment = The Tesaka have never been part of the Antanosy or Betsimisaraka in any way
	whatsoever- it was a glitsch of our map and of the ISO process that they ended
	up erroneously as an alternate name for the Betsimisaraka.in the Ethnologue.
	
	The Atesaka are a large people group with a very definite separate identity and
	language. The Atesaka tend to migrate all over the island in search of work, but
	always keep that group identity. When an Atesaka dies outside the Tesaka area,
	the body is transported back to the ancestral land. When preparing the ground
	for the Tesaka translation of Luke, we had to visit with the "kings" of the
	"telo troky" (=three stomachs) and with the fourth who claims to have a valid
	claim to royalty. The Tesaka language is roughly between 70% and 80% similar to
	Official Malagasy, 76% with Tanosy; 78% with Betsimisaraka. The Tesaka
	distinguish themselves very definitely from the Merina and from those around
	them.
