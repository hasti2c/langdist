comment = The current name Pokomo does not reflect the language name according to the
	speech community. They say that their language name is Kipfokomo The "Upper"
	distinction is no longer needed, as this proposal also recommends the merging of
	Lower Pokomo [poj] with Upper Pokomo to have a single code element encompassing
	all of Kipfokomo, nee "Pokomo".
	
	The current distinction between Upper Pokomo and Lower Pokomo is not so much a
	matter of linguistic intelligibility as it is of other distinctions. On
	linguistic grounds (including use of literature), these should be considered one
	language.
