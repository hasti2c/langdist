comment = There is no evidence to show that this language has ever existed. Different
	ethnic groups of the Enlhet-Enenlhet (or Maskoy) family certainly have lived
	together in the Puerto La Victoria area (just as in several other regions of the
	Chaco), but, as we observe in these contexts today (and as witnesses indicate
	regarding the Puerto La Victoria region in the past), no type of pidgin has
	developed. Either a dominant language has been used by all, or members of each
	group have used their own language and the others have developed the ability to
	understand it (a passive bi- or multilingualism). In addition, in areas of
	contact between Enlhet-Enenlhet languages, the ethnic groups of this family have
	quickly begun to speak Guarani with each other. In any case, today no
	Enlhet-Enenlhet language is spoken in the Puerto La Victoria region; ethnic
	groups belonging to the Enlhet-Enenlhet speak an adapted version of Paraguayan
	Guarani.
