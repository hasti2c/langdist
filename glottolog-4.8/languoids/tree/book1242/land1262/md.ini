comment = Land Dayak is a language family name (the current term is actually "Bidayuhic"),
	rather than a language name. Furthermore, all Bidayuhic (Land Dayak)
	geographical locations and populations are already accounted for by other
	Bidayuhic language entries. This entry duplicates geographies and populations,
	and should be retired.
