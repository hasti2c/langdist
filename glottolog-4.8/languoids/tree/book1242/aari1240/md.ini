	Hugoniot, Richard.1970. A bibliographical Index of the Lesser Known Languages
	and Dialects of India and Nepal. Waxhaw: Summer Institute of Linguistics.
	
	
	Hugoniot's source was [Madhya Pradesh Dept. of Tribal Welfare, The Tribes of
	Madhya Pradesh, Bhopal 1964.] Aariya was listed as a Scheduled Tribe at that
	time but not listed in the more recent Anthropological Society of India research
	on peoples of India edited by K.S. Singh. Surveyors in the area in 2004 found
	nobody who had even heard of this language.
