[iso_retirement]
comment = Yotti is listed as a dialect of Yendang. This was a mistake, as they are
	linguistically and socially distinct. In an interview in Mayo Lope in 2007, the
	Yotti individuals said that they have two origins: some clans come from Yoro
	(linking them with Mumuye [mzm]) and others from Bolki (linking them with Bacama
	[bcy]). They report than many are bilingual in Mumuye [mzm] and Yendang from an
	eariy age, but there are some Yotti (particularly the Nyagbalaŋ and Yɛyɪpte
	clans) who do not understand Yendang well.
	
	Intelligibility testing with children in Bonding (a Yotti village) showed very
	poor understanding of a text recorded in Kpankwai (a Yendang village).
	
	Lexical similarity: 35% with Bali [bcn], 35% with Kpasham [pbn], 13% with
	Yendang [yen].
	
	Population: Yotti have about eight villages compared with many more than thirty
	Yendang villages.
