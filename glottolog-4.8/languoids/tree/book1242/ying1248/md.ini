comment = I do not believe that there exists evidence justifying the treatment of Yinglish
	as a separate language from English, rather than a dialect with Yiddish-derived
	vocabulary and occasional aberrant Yiddish-derived syntax. The differences
	between English and Yinglish are simply not comparable to the differences
	between German and Yiddish or Spanish and Ladino. In fact, Yinglish fits
	smoothly into the English dialect continuum. Yinglish is readily understood by
	speakers of plain English, provided the lexical items are explained, and even
	some of them have now entered the lexicon of colloquial American English, as
	your mavin Joshua Fishman notes. If there are enough unusual items, as in
	Yeshiva English, the speech may be unintelligible to the uninstructed listener,
	but no more so than the technical talk of pilots, doctors, or computer
	programmers. (Some borrowed words have un-English phonologies, but so do "Bach"
	and "oeuvre" as pronounced by many English speakers.) Furthermore, U.S. and U.K.
	Yinglish are about as different as U.S. and U.K. English, though segregating the
	first two into a separate language would lead us to expect that they would stand
	together as against non-Jewish dialects of English.  Orthographically (which is
	relevant to the sociolinguistics), Yinglish is invariably written in Latin
	script using mostly English conventions, quite unlike the various Jewish
	languages, which are mostly written in Hebrew script using their own
	conventions. Finally, the Ethnologue claim that Yinglish is "a second language
	only" is misleading. It is not a *second* language which some English-speakers
	also command; it is for the most part the particular way in which those
	English-speakers speak their first language, English (There are some
	Yinglish-speakers whose first Request for Change to ISO 639-3 Language Code,
	page 2
	
	language is not English, of course.) Furthermore, the number and variety of
	Yinglish features in a particular speaker's speech (or writing) is under direct
	control: one can use more or fewer of them as appropriate. I've used only one in
	this letter. (On a separate note, the term "Ameridish", listed in the Ethnologue
	as a synonym for Yinglish, wasn't originally meant to be: it was coined by
	Rosten to refer to Eastern Yiddish as spoken in the United States, with English
	lexical influences. He occasionally lost track of his own distinction, defining
	"opstairsiker/keh" as Yinglish and "donstairsiker/keh" as Ameridish for upstairs
	and downstairs neighbor respectively; both terms can be seen as either. But then
	again, Samuel Johnson defined "windward" and "leeward" the same way!)
