comment = The distinctions between these two varieties has been a matter of some confusion
	for decades. This is primarily due to the fact that [yio] speakers are
	officially classified under the Yi nationality and [lpo] speakers are officially
	classified under the Lisu nationality. Numerous complex geographic,
	sociolinguistic, cultural and historical factors are behind this
	distinction--none of which seem to be directly related to the
	inter-intelligibility and/or in- group identity of the Lipo speakers themselves.
	Bradley has engaged in extensive research on Lipo dialects as part of his larger
	research focus on Central Ngwi varieties in general. Based on his own on-site
	survey work, he has observed the two to be mutually intelligible dialects of the
	same language and closely aligned ethnically in spite of an otherwise highly
	ramified sociolinguistic situation linked to various group-external factors.
