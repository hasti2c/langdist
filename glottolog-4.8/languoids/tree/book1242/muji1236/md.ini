comment = This split is proposed based on findings from formal linguistic survey work on
	the Phula languages of Yunnan Province, China, carried out from 2005-2006. Eight
	of the 40 villages visited during this research period were closely affiliated
	ethnolinguistically with ISO code [ymj]. Research components explored lexicon,
	identity, contact and intelligibility, and the results point to five
	synchronically distinct languages originally subsumed under [ymj]. Communication
	and transportation have traditionally been limited between these varieties,
	though they are all closely related phylogenetically. The most vital and
	prototypical Muji variety, Southern Muji, also has the largest number of
	speakers. Rationale for identifying the other four languages as distinct from
	[ymj] is given below.
	
	[ymx] or Northern Muji speakers yeilded a mean score of .60 on a recorded text
	test from [ymc] with a high standard deviation of 24 suggesting that a mobile
	demographic has learned intelligibility with [ymj]. Anecdotal and perceptual
	information from [ymx] and [ymc] speakers alike confirms a distinction between
	the two, and speakers report significant learning time (longer than two months)
	being required in order to communicate in their respective Muji lects. A similar
	situation is reported between [ymx] and [ymz].
	
	The smaller [ymi] and [ymq] (Moji and Qila Muji) varieties have apparently been
	separated from Muji proper for centuries and evidence numerous unique lexical
	and phonological characteristics as a result of independent change and language
	contact with other varieties. Lexical similarity in core vocabulary between
	these two and the other Muji varieties is lower than 60%--sufficiently low to
	posit the presence of mutually unintelligible synchronic languages without
	resorting to formal intelligibility testing. Although [ymq] shares a
	
	marginal 60% core lexical similarity with [ymc], a [ymc] recorded text test
	played for [ymq] speakers yeilded a mean score of only .38 with a low standard
	deviation.
	
	[ymz] or Muzi speakers also scored low on the [ymc] recorded text test (.50) ,
	and [ymx] speakers report that a bride who married out from their area to a
	[ymz] village required six months to one year before she was able to function in
	the [ymz] variety.
