comment = Makuri Naga and Para Naga share very low lexical similarity with Khiamniungan
	Naga. Inherent intelligibility should therefore be low. Ethnolinguistic identity
	is separate between these three groups (Makuri and Para each show signs of
	strong language vitality), and there is no known common literature. Also, there
	is not any known intermediate variety that would be intelligible to any pair of
	these three language groups.
