comment = The Wolane language area is separated from the Silte area, being some 30-40 kms
	away from each other. It is true that there is inherent intelligibility to some
	degree, but the Wolane strongly feel like being ethnically separate from the
	Silte. The Wolane feel like belonging to the Gurage people, with whom they are
	direct neighbors and have close links with. On administrative level, the Wolane
	did not want to be part of the Silte Zone, but of the Gurage zone.
	
	The Wolane speech variety does not have its own writing system, as opposed to
	Silte where an orthography was adopted some 10 years ago. In the Silte area, the
	Medium of Instruction (MoI) is Silte, but the Wolane use Amharic.
	
	In terms of religion, the vast majority of Silte are Muslims, whereas this is
	only true for part of the Wolane, quite a percentage of them are following
	Ethiopian orthodox Christianity.
