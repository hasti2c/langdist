comment = Susnik's widespread hypothesis has been disproved: she proposed that the Toba of
	Puerto Casado constitute a mixed ethnic group, of "Toba [Qom] groups who blended
	with the Maskoy, forming the new Emok-Toba ethnic identity. The first generation
	was bilingual, but the Toba language later became established as the 'language
	of men'" (Susnik 1989: 144), and supposedly went on to form "a 'Maskoyized'
	proletariat in the tannin factories" of Puerto Casado (ibid.). Our research
	leaves no doubt that the indigenous population of the tannin ports on the River
	Paraguay is of purely Enlhet-Enenlhet descendency. In spite of the existence of
	communities such as Cerrito and El Padernal where people of Enlhet- Enenlhet and
	Qom descendency live together, bilingualism across the two language groups has
	not developed, and Guarani is the main language of intercommunication. That is,
	an Emok language (classified as extinct) in fact never existed. Emmo'ok is not
	the name of a language; it means simply 'our neighbour' in the languages of the
	Enlhet-Enenlhet family. This explains why we have found no instances of a
	supposed Emok language; nor of any evidence shown by Susnik, who made her
	hypothesis for its existence so widely known.
