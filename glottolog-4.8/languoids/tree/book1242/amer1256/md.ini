comment = There may be evidence that some distinct variety of English is in use by
	"Neo-muslims in prisons" (Gordon, 2005:298) but insufficient evidence to treat
	it as a separate language. It is presumably some variety of English with
	possible influences from Arabic. It may not in fact be "fully intelligible" with
	standard English but probably doesn't merit being separately identified as a
	language under ISO 639-3.
