comment = There is 82% lexical similarity between Tomyang and Yamphu. The original
	Ethnologue entry for Tomyang was created before this data became available. A
	news article in a local newspaper stated that a new language, Tomyang, had been
	discovered by Nepali linguists. Further information revealed that the only
	Tomyang data collected was a Swadish 100 words list. And out of those, 21% are
	Nepali loan words. Also the wordlist was collected outside the area in which it
	is spoken and was, therefore, not compared to Yamphu, which is the main language
	in that area. It is proposed to list Tomyang as a dialect of Yamphu until more
	information could confirm it is a separate language.
