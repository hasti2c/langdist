[iso_retirement]
comment = Col (pronounced 'chole' or 'chool') is the name the speakers of this variety of
	Malayic use for themselves in the areas surveyed, with the exception of the Col
	speakers from Lembak Delapan, a small pocket of Col speakers near Bengkulu City.
	The other regions where Col is spoken were not familiar with the term Lembak,
	but had heard of the term Saling and Sindang Kelingi. The general term used by
	this group for its language and by neighboring language groups is "Col", their
	word for "there isn't" or "none". If Col is not used, we recommend using the
	name "Sindang" as this is the name used in the government's linguistic
	literature on the language and is placed in front of the name of the dialect of
	Col under consideration, i.e. Sindang Kelingi, Sindang Beliti...The term Lembak
	should be changed to an alternate name or dropped as the majority of the Col
	population has not heard of this term and for those living in or near to South
	Sumatra, it brings to mind the Musi dialect Belide.
