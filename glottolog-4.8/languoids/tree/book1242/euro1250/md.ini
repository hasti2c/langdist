comment = Existing litterature (see for example: http://www.europanto.be/gram.en.html)
	states very clearly that Europanto is not a Language name. So, there is no
	reason at all to maintain "eur" inside ISO 639-3
	
	COMMENT BY PURODHA BLISSENBACH:
	
	Please do not retire code eur as of request 2008-087.
	There is quite some published materials using Europanto in Brussels
	newspapers. Writing about it and quoting it in internet sites needs an
	appropriate language code.
	
	Otherwise speech synthesizers, search programs, indexing programs, and other
	will not be able to function properly since there would be no way to identify
	the language.
	
	Since at least for linguist publications (and some fun for general
	public, certainly, too) referring to Europanto both as a concept and in the form
	of samples of text, is useful, we cannot do without a language code. Greetings.
	Purodha Blissenbach
