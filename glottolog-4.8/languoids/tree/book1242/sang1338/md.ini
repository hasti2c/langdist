comment = The present codes for Mandaya (mrt, mry, and mst) do not represent dialects of
	Mandaya but data collection points when Andrew Gallman was gathering data for
	his dissertation some 30 years ago. In reality it is all the same language with
	a purer Mandaya in the mountains and more of a mixed variety of Mandaya along
	the coast. All of it is Mandaya.
