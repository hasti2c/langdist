comment = There is currently an SIL linguist working in the area who is finding out that
	North Korowai is intelligible with Korowai. Quoting him from an email: "We
	haven't done any dialect intelligibility testing yet, but lexical similarity is
	90% and they seem to understand each other without trouble. During the Baseline
	Study we had a South Korowai speaker do the interpretation and when we asked
	North Korowai speakers if they had any questions about the purpose of our
	Baseline Study they replied that they had just heard the explanation in their
	own language, so they had no questions. And from their actions is was clear that
	they understood. I myself can understand North Korowai speakers, if they do not
	speak too fast. Their pronunciation is a bit different and I plan to look into
	that in the future. North and South have some differing vocabulary but seem to
	have no problem understanding each other. Grammar doesn't seem to be different."
