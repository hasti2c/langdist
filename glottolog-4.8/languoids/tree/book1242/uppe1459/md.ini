[iso_retirement]
comment = Kenyah, Upper Baram is a vague name associated mainly to toponym or ethnonym of
	some Kenyah groups. The name was proposed by Wurm and Hattori (1981) mainly
	based on what Soriente (2005:19) calls "superficial analysis focusing on
	geographic and administrative boundaries". Using the means of comparative
	linguistics methodology, Soriente (2005) is able to re-classify the variants of
	Kenyah.
	
	[RA comment: This Kenyah language is being requested to be retired as
	"non-existent" because it is not clear to which of the two Kenyah languages (one
	existing, but expanded, and the other newly defined) the former geographically
	specified language would belong. See requests 2007-245 and 2007-246.]
