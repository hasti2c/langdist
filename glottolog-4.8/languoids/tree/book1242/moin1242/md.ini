comment = Monpa (or Moinba) is a cover term meaning "man of the lower country" and is used
	to refer to several ethnically related peoples which may not be related
	linguistically. Andvik states "The Monpa label is unfortunate, in that it
	separates languages which should be grouped together, while joining under a
	common name languages which should not be grouped together." Other publications
	(listed below) have indicated high variation in language among the Monpa groups
	we had previously listed under Moinba [mob].
	
	Survey in 2005 has helped us sort out the various groups. The highest lexical
	similarity percentage among these 5 varieties are Chug with Lish - 62%. Informal
	comprehension testing indicated that Chug speakers had difficulty fully
	understanding a Lish story. The next highest similarity is Kalaktang with
	Tshangla_tsj - 62 â€“ 71%. Kalaktang speakers averaged 55% intelligibility of a
	Tshangla RTT with high standard deviation. Lish & Chug with Tawang and Kalaktang
	-15-21% LXS, Kalaktang with Tawang - 26-28% LXS. The closest language to Sartang
	is Sherdukpen with lexical similarity 49% to 60%. Sartang is less than 32%
	similar to the other 4 Monpa languages. Although I personally doubt the accuracy
	of the LXS numbers, they do indicate a great deal of variation which confirms
	similar statements by published sources.
