comment = Kucong speakers are classified under the Lahu nationality in China but are, in
	most cases, separated from the primary Lahu population by significant distances
	and are often reported on distinctly in Chinese sources (cf. YJDZ 1983).
	Ethnologue 15 confuses Kucong with Lahu Shi, but Kucong speakers are not
	particularly affiliated with Lahu Shi (Yellow Lahu) any more than they are with
	Lahu Na (Black Lahu). Speakers applied for distinct nationality status in the
	early 1980â€™s, but, instead, were classified under the Lahu nationality in 1989.
	Speakers in Vietnam belong to the Cosung Nationality. Bradley (2002:104) notes
	that Kucong is not mutually intelligible with Lahu.
