comment = It was discovered that the Ethnologue entries for India_Digaro Mishmi_mhu and
	China_Darang Deng_dat are referring to the same language. Darang Deng is an
	alternate name for mhu. Digaro and Taraon are alternate names for Darang Deng.
	The locations for each language are just across the India/China border from each
	other. they are both classified in the North Assam branch of the Sino-Tibetan
	language tree. It is proposed that the name Darang Deng be retained for China
	but assume the same language code as Digaro Mishmi, with India being the HUB
	country for the language.
