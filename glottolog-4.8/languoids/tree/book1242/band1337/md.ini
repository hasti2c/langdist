comment = In addition to this change in primary name, there is also evidence that
	Paakantyi should be merged with Bandjigali (bjd), which Ethnologue classifies as
	a separate language (Bowern 2011b; AUSTLANG 2011).
	
	Wafer and Lisserrague state that "Hercus has demonstrated in detail (1980, 1982,
	1989, 1993, 1994) that the various distinct but closely related language
	varieties in this group... are dialects of a single language. She divides the
	"Darling River (Paakantyi) Language Group" into the 'northern dialects' and the
	'southern dialects'" (2008: 264).
	
	Bandjigali (bjd) is considered by Bowern (2011b), AUSTLANG, and Wafer and
	Lisserague (2008: 263, 276) to be one of many dialects of Paakanti and it should
	be merged with Paakantyi. Wafer and Lisserague follow Hercus 1993 in how she
	groups the dialects:
	
	Paakantyi: language
	
	1. Northern Paakantyi (Northern Darling River): Dialect Group (2008: 263)
	.    - Paaruntyi: Dialect (2008: 268)
	.    - Kurnu: Dialect (2008: 269)
	.    - Nhaawuparlku: Dialect (2008: 270)
	.    - Milpulo: Dialect (2008: 271)
	
	2. Southern Paakantyi (Southern Darling River): Dialect Group (2008: 263)
	.    - Wilyaali: Dialect (2008: 272)
	.    - Thangkaali: Dialect (2008: 273)
	.    - Pulaali: Dialect (2008: 274)
	.    - Wanyuparlku: Dialect (2008: 275)
	.    - Pantyikali: (Ethnologue's Bandjigali, bjd) Dialect (2008: 276)
	.    - Marrawarra: Dialect (2008: 277)
	.    - Southern Paakantyi (Proper): Dialect (2008: 278)
	.    - Parrintyi: Dialect (2008: 279)
	
	Paakantyi is still considered to be the sole member of a subgroup variously
	called Paakantyi by Bowern (2010a) and AUSTLANG (2011) and Darling River Group
	by Lissarrague and Wafer (2008: 263). This subgroup is part of the Pama-Nyungan
	family.
