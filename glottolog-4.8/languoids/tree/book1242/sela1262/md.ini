comment = Adelaar (1992 and 2002) confirms that Selako and Ahe are part of the Kendayan
	language chain and are mutually intelligible with each other along with several
	other Kendayan dialects. Collins (personal communication - email 2007), confirms
	that Ahe, Selako, and Kendayan are all fully intelligible with each other.‚Äù
