comment = Grimes and Grimes (1987) Languages of South Sulawesi, proposed two languages to
	the east of the Toraja area: Toala' and Rongkong. Even though the Grimeses' own
	computations showed Toala' and Rongkong to be 83% cognate, one consideration for
	not combining the languages was that Rongkong speakers themselves viewed their
	language as separate. However, a follow-up survey of the Toraja language area
	(Valkama 1987, WILC vol. 5) revealed dialect chaining which was more complex
	than the Grimeses' initial survey had indicated, with no particular reason to
	demark the two languages. In their update to Languages of South Sulawesi, Tim
	Friberg and Tom Laskowske (1989, NUSA vol. 31) proposed that these two languages
	be combined and be renamed the Rongkong- Luwu' language.
	
	In 1988, Ian and Tanya Vail began living in the area, in order to investigate
	the situation in greater detail. After an extensive survey, which involved
	living in six different locations in Kabupaten Luwu, Vail concurred (Vail 1991)
	that the languages be combined, but suggested that the language be named Tae'
	after the negative term which is used throughout the area (this term was also
	acceptable to speakers themselves as a language name). However, this term is
	neither definitive nor unambiguous, since tae'is also the negative term in
	Sa'dan Toraja (compare for example Van der Veen's 1940 Tae' Woordenboek, which
	is a dictionary of Sa'dan Toraja, not Rongkong-Luwu').
	
	Unfortunately, these later suggestions were only halfway incorporated into the
	Ethnologue, which up through the 14th and 15th editions, had changed the name of
	Rongkong to Tae' but maintained Toala' as a separate language. The data listed
	under Tae' (location, dialects, etc.) in the Ethnologue, 14th and 15th eds.,
	partly assume that the languages were merged, and yet partly assume that the
	languages are separate.
	
	One curiosity is where Chuck and Barbara Grimes even got the name Toala'. They
	write on page 49, "There has been great diversity in the previous classification
	of Toala'..." and so one might assume from the following discussion that Esser,
	Van der Veen, Salzner, Mills and the authors of the Peta Bahasa had all
	mentioned a Toala' language, but this is not true. The term Toala' is used only
	by Salzner, who listed it under his Makasar-Bugi group (see page 15), but never
	gave it a location on his Southern Sulawesi map (map no. 23). Since Salzner did
	not do any original research in Sulawesi, he must have picked up this term from
	someone else, but we could not track down this earlier source. Noorduyn calls
	Toala' "an exceedingly inapt exonym ... meaning 'people of the forest'"
	(1991:203). The preferred self-designation is Luwu', and "there is little chance
	of confusion with the Luwu dialect of Bugis" (Friberg and Laskowske 1989:9).
	
	Following Vail (1991), there are four dialects of Tae'. Major subdialects of
	Tae' appear to be:
	
	- Northeast Luwu' (= Bone-bone = Masamba)
	
	- Rongkong
	
	= Seko Lemo
	
	= Rongkong Atas
	
	= Rongkong Bawah (= Sabbang)
	
	- Bua
	
	- South Luwu'
	
	= Bajo (=Palili')
	
	= Bastem (=Toala')
	
	
	However, integrating the dialect descriptions of Valkama (1987:125, 127),
	Friberg and Laskowske (1989:9) and Vail (1991:79) is not without its
	difficulties. In particular, Valkama writes as if Rongkong Bawah and Sabbang are
	separate subdialects, and places the latter within his North Luwu dialect.
	Valkama also uses the inelegant terms Northern South Luwu' and Southern South
	Luwu'. These terms are especially to be avoided since once Bua is removed from
	his Northern South Luwu' (following Vail 1991), the split is more east- west
	rather than north-south. The Bastem and Bajo subdialects are named after
	kecamatans (subdistricts), but both are spoken more broadly than the respective
	kecamatan borders. Bastem is a mountain kecamatan which borders on the Toraja
	area. Finally, it is unclear from Ian Vail's report whether Bone-bone and
	Masamba are to be regarded as synonyms for Northeast Luwu', or whether they
	should be regarded as separate, marginally different subdialects under Northeast
	Luwu'. Kari Valkama took only one word list in this area, so it is impossible to
	resolve the issue by investigating Kari's primary data.
