comment = These five Southern Zhuang languages are not mutually intelligible with each
	other and have no common literature. They have been grouped into the same
	official nationality (Zhuang) since 1958 by the government (along with speakers
	of ccx, Northern Zhuang,
	
	and Buyang), but previously did not share a common ethnolinguistic identity.
	There is no central variety or reference dialect for all five either (most
	commonly some dialect of Chinese is used as lingua franca among speakers of
	different Southern Zhuang langauges).
