comment = Southern and Southwestern Nisu were originally grouped together and referred to
	as Yuanjiang-Mojiang Nisu. However, the lack of mutual intelligibility between
	these two varieties suggests instead that they should be split into two distinct
	languages. During 2006, Ken Chan (also with EAG) and Cathryn Yang carried out a
	dialect survey of Nisu, in which they tested Northern and Southern Nisu speakers
	if they could understand a Southwestern Nisu RTT. Only one Northern Nisu data
	point could adequately comprehend (RTT score avg. 80%); all the other N and S
	Nisu points failed to adequately comprehend SW Nisu (scores below 80%, often 50
	or 60%). Also, they tested SW Nisu speakers on how well
	
	they could understand N and S Nisu varieties. The SW Nisu speakers were unable
	to adequately comprehend any of the other Nisu varieties. SW Nisu is
	linguistically very closely related to both N and S Nisu, but the speakers moved
	away from the Northern Nisu area several generations ago to the southwest.
	Because of the lack of mutual intelligibility with other Nisu languages, Chan
	and Yang concluded that SW Nisu was a related but divergent Nisu
	language.Northern Nisu refers to [yiv], currently named Eshan-Xinping Yi (name
	change requested).
