comment = Laomian is sometimes included in Bisu by Chinese linguists. Xu (2005:100)
	confirms this affiliation but notes that degrees of intelligibility vary between
	Thailand Bisu and Laomian speakers in different areas; in contrast, Xu reports
	that the related dialect Laopin shares ease of intelligibility with Bisu.
	Bradley (2002:106) recommends Laomian as a distinct language, and remarks
	(personal communication) that intelligibility between Bisu and Laomian is low in
	particular. Zhang (2004) also considers Laomian to be a distinct variety.
	Bradley recommends that Laopin (spoken by only 240 people in China) be
	considered a dialect of Thailand Bisu [bii] and Laomian be considered a distinct
	language [lwm]* closely related to Bisu [bii].
