comment = People in Gabutamon village consider themselves Domung speakers, and people in
	all other Domung villages consider Gabutamon to be a Domung village. Gabutamon
	people reported understanding speakers from all Domung villages well, and
	speakers from all but two Domung villages reported understanding people from
	Gabutamon well. The two Domung villages that reported to not understand
	Gabutamon speakers well are from the opposite end of the Domung dialect chain.
	People from Gabutamon and other Domung villages are working together
	successfully on a Scripture translation project.
	
	Reported data suggests that there is a dialect chain in the Domung area with
	Gabutamon at one end and Sibgou, Kian, Dirit and Maramung at the other. Each
	village had a different way of breaking the chain into dialects. Putting the
	different reported dialects together suggests the chain is as follows, starting
	from the Gabutamon end: Gabutamon; Maum and Kosit; Wakopop and Bobongat; Aunon;
	Ayengket; Sibgou, Kian, Dirit, Swantan and Maramung. This is shown in the
	attached map.
	
	Lexical similarity percentages support the fact that Gabutamon village is part
	of the Domung dialect chain. The map shows that Gabutamon is as closely related
	to Domung villages as the other Domung villages are to each other. For example,
	Gabutamon and Kian, villages on the opposite ends of the Domung dialect chain,
	both share 70% or more lexical similarity with two central Domung villages
	(Bobongat and Ayengket).
	
	The criteria used by the survey team (based on 1991 ILAC recommendations) to
	determine language boundaries is listed below.
	
	-At least 70% lexical similarity with a linguistically determined central
	dialect;
	
	-Either high reported comprehension of a central dialect or intelligibility of
	at least 75% of a central dialect
	
	-Shared ethnolinguistic identity with the central dialect
	
	Villages at both ends of the Domung dialect chain (Gabutamon and Kian) meet
	these criteria and should be included as part of the Domung language.
