comment = Lexical similarity percentages between the two varieties are between sixty-six
	and seventy-six percent, depending on the dialect of Yaleba, of which there are
	three. Between the Soma'a dialect and Wagawaga, lexical similarity is 66%;
	between the Sileba dialect and Wagawaga it is 72%; between the Gamadoudou
	dialect and Wagawaga it is 76%. Furthermore, intelligibility testing between
	Yaleba and Wagawaga revealed that intelligibility between the two varieties is
	only marginal and they do not share a common ethnolinguistic identity.‚Äù
