comment = The name Kenyah, Kelinyau, was proposed by Wurm and Hattori (1981) mainly based
	on what Soriente (2005:19) calls "superficial analysis focusing on geographic
	and administrative boundaries". Using the means of comparative linguistics
	methodology, it is possible to clarify the variations the Kenyah group. By
	investigating the shared innovation among the various Kenyah group, Soriente
	(2005) proposes that the names above- mentioned be used to incorporate all the
	other variants of another subgroup of Kenyah which further divided into four
	minor categories (which for the sake of simplicity here will be only referred to
	as "group 1-4". Group 1 language incorporates dialects of Lepo Tau, Lepo Bem,
	Uma Jalan, Uma Tukung, Lepo Jengan, Lepo Aga, Uma Ake, Lepo Ga, Lepo La'ang,
	Sambup and Likan. Group 2 language incorporates the dialect of Lepo Ke', and
	Lepo Kuda. Group 3 language incorporates dialect of Lepo Ma'ut, Lepo Ndang,
	Badeng, and Lepo Jamok. Group 4 language incorporate dialects of Bakung and Lepo
	Teppu'
