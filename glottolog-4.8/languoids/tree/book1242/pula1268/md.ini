comment = Based on recent linguistic survey findings with research components exploring
	identity, contact and intelligibility, we recommend that [ypl] should be split
	into three closely related, but synchronically distinct languages. Speaker
	perceptions and recorded text test scores both point to low intelligibility
	between Phola [ypg] and Phala [ypa]*. Undirectional intelligibility from Phala
	to Phola is apparent in middle-aged to elderly speakers, but younger speakers
	who have had less contact are unable to converse in Phala or Phola and must
	resort to Chinese. Based on the views of in-group and out-group members alike,
	ethnic identity and material culture also confirm this distinction.
	
	The proposed language [ypo], or Alo Phola, is reported by Phola speakers to be
	an unintelligible dialect of Phola spoken in a village in central Yuanjiang
	County. The village is surrounded by Dai villages, and Phola speakers say the
	language sounds like a mix of Phola, Chinese and Dai. Speakers from the two
	varieties reportedly must resort to Chinese in order to communicate.
