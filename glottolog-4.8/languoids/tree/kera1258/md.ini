family = The emerging evidence for the Keram family is summarized in **hh:g:Barlow:Pondi**:14-17. Ap Ma/Botin/Kambot shows some typological similarities to the Grass, Banaro and Ramu languages but there is little lexical evidence **hh:hvld:Zgraggen:Madang**:168-169 **hh:hv:Foley:Sepik:2013** **hh:typ:Brooks:Chini**:70. Similarly, Ambakich [aew] has too little evidence to be included in the Lower Sepik-Ramu family at the present state of documentation **hh:typ:Brooks:Chini**:70.
