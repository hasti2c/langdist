[classification]
family = Narrow Talodi (exluding Tegem) is held together by pronouns, lexical cognates, and form-meaning resemblances in the noun class systems. Tegem systematically stands out lexically, pronominally, in the noun class system and alleged sound correspondences are often irregular. The alleged noun class form/meaning correspondences to other Kordofanian groups, namely Rashad and Heibanic, in **hh:hv:Schadeberg:Kordofanian**, **hh:hv:Schadeberg:Kordofanische** are not convincing as conclusively genetic. As to form, there is much eclectic selection as well as irregular correspondences, and as to meaning, the methodology of finding non-cognate shared class items is highly dubious. Chance resemblance has not been excluded. The lexical evidence for a Kordofanian unity is weak in the extreme **hh:hv:Blench:Kordofanian**. It follows that the arguments presented for a Niger-Congo affiliation are not compelling either **hh:hv:Guldemann:Africa:Classification**:223-231, 232-234, 353-358.
