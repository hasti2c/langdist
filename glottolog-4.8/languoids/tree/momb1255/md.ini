[classification]
family = Pronouns do not match sufficiently well for an immediate Trans New Guinea
	affiliation, and apart from this, there are only capricious lexical similarities
	to other families **hh:hvld:Voorhoeve:CWTNG**:396-398. Internally, Koneraw and
	Mombum (aka Komelom) can be seen to be related from the basic vocabulary
	correspondences in **hh:hw:Geurtjens:Marindineesche**.
