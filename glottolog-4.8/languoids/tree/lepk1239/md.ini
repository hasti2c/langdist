[classification]
family = Though not fortcoming from the lexicostatistical counts in **hh:hwsoc:Wambaliau:Murkim**, looking the actual words in the two languages, there are too many similarities to be mere chance (contra **hh:hb:Hammarstrom:Least**). The short unpublished 35-item Kembra wordlist also contains significant matches, warranting the inclusion of this language in the family.
