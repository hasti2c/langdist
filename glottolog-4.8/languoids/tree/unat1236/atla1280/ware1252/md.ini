comment = Neither we, the SIL-UTB survey team, nor any other people we have spoken to have
	heard of the Ware people. Since no information is given in the current
	Ethnologue entry as to the location of the Ware it is difficult to say
	conclusively that they do not exist, but the genetic classification of E.10
	suggest that they would be located in the north of Tanzania.
	
	In July 2005 and January/February 2006 the UTB survey team was in Mara Region,
	Tanzania where many of the languages in the E.10 group to which Ware is said to
	belong are located, and found no knowledge of the Ware. An SIL language team
	located in Arusha Region also failed to discover any knowledge of the Ware
	amongst the people in their area.
	
	Since there seems to be no knowledge of the Ware in northern Tanzania now, we
	would recommend retiring this language code element.
