[classification]
family = The inclusion of the poorly known Karas is best argued in
	**hh:hvw:Cowan:Ambtelijk**:33-36, with systematic correspondences in pronominals
	and a few items of basic vocabulary. Evidence for inclusion in Trans New Guinea
	is weak **hh:hvld:Voorhoeve:CWTNG**:432-437, both lexically and pronominally,
	cf. **hh:hv:Pawley:Chequered-TNG**:94-95. Likewise, the East Timor/Alor
	comparisons in **hh:hv:Hull:Timor** are flimsy.
