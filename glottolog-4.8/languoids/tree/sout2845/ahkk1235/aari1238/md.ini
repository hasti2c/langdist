comment = Speakers of Gayil have very little understanding of the southern variety of
	Aari, based on the results of comprehension testing conducted with recorded
	southern Aari texts. The current language development effort for southern Aari,
	including the translation of literature and a literacy program, does not include
	Gayil speakers even though Gayil has in the past been considered a dialect of
	Aari. The Gayil do not understand southern Aari literature and have requested
	separate language development. According to Gayil interviewees, from their point
	of view they have a separate ethnolinguistic identity from the southern Aari.
	The Gayil people's distinct ethnolinguistic identity is reinforced by the fact
	that they are geographically isolated from the southern Aari area and have
	little to do with the southern Aari people, dealing mostly with the Basketo
	people to the north.
