[classification]
family = The family is assumed on lexical similarities hinted at by Laycock. What little
	data on Yuat that was available to Foley in connection with his demonstration of
	the Lower Sepik-Ramu family, it was not sufficient for a genetic relationship
	with Lower Sepik-Ramu. Sufficient argumentation for a relation with the
	Mongol-Langam languages is wanting **hh:hv:Laycock:Sepik**.
