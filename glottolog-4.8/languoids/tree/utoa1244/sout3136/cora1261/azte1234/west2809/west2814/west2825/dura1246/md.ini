comment = Based on phonological, grammatical, and lexical differences (see attached
	documentation), there are two linguistic variants in this language which make it
	difficult to convert materials in one variant directly to the other. When
	speakers of the two variants try to communicate in their language, they have so
	much trouble understanding each other that they usually use Spanish instead.
	Furthermore, there are several words that appear to be the same in the two
	variants that show significant semantic shift. There is approximately 85%
	comprehension between the two variants, which makes the speakers think they
	should be able to communicate in their language, but in fact they usually find
	it impossible. This has been confirmed by linguistic and sociolinguistic studies
	(see bibliography).
	
	In the cultural realm, the Eastern variant has conserved more of their
	traditional beliefs than has the Western variant, where only some very elderly
	speakers still know them. Another factor has been the invasion of the Eastern
	variant by migrating speakers of Southeastern Tepehuan (stp), causing cultural
	and linguistic changes. In the Western variant, there are fewer such influences,
	especially in the communities in Durango State (San Agustin de Buenaventura,
	Curachitos de Buenavista, San Diego, Tepetates II (Berenjenas), Alacranes and
	Tepalcates). Except for Tepalcates, all these communities still use the language
	in all aspects of daily life, probably because there are few other linguistic
	influences in their isolated area. They even use Nahuatl when they talk on their
	"walkie talkies." Thus this area can be considered the heart of the ethnic
	group, because there the language and culture are preserved.
	
	There are, however, some trends toward moderization that threated their cultural
	identity.
	
	In Nayarit State, the same Western variant is spoken in four places (Santa Cruz,
	La Laguna, Mesa de las Arpas, and El Duraznito). The language is more threatened
	there, since these four communities have fewer speakers and are surrounded by
	large communities of Cora and Huichol speakers. This has caused the loss of the
	language in some parts to the extent that symptoms of language death are
	evident. In the schools of these four communities, Nayarit State has created a
	program to promote the use of the language, including training teachers in the
	language and in positive attitudes toward it, but in the homes it is often not
	spoken by the children, although they still understand it. The older traditional
	authorities also favor the creation of materials to promote the use of the
	language.
