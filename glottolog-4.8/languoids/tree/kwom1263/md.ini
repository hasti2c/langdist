[classification]
family = Laycock never presented real evidence for a Kwomtari-Baibai-Pyu family **hh:hv:Laycock:SkoKwomtariLeftMay**. The membership is Kwomtari [kwo], Biaka/Nai [bio] and not Fas [fqs] as many sources have erroneously repeated **hh:g:Honeyman:Momu**:6-10. It is clear from the data collected so far **hh:hvs:Baron:Kwomtari** that Guriaso [grx] shares no more lexical cognates with Kwomtari and Biaka than expected at random, and that's not even when borrowing is discounted (Kwomtari neighbours Guriaso). Further correspondences presented are merely typological or random enough to make Japanese a Kwomtari language **hh:hvs:Baron:Kwomtari**:29.
