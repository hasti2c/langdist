comment = Lexical similiarity of Dari and Darwazi is between 86% and 90%. Comprehension
	testing of Eastern Farsi (Dari) showed that Dari is highly intelligible for the
	Darwazi people. The Darwazi call their area Darwaz but not their speech variety.
	No one ever mentioned a language called Darwazi as his mother tongue. The
	Darwazi themselves explain that they speak Dari, acknowledging that their
	dialect is slightly different.
