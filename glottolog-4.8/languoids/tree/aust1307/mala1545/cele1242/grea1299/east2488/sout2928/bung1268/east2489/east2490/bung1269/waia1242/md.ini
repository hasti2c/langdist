[classification]
family = **hh:hv:Wurm:Trans-Fly**:325 claims that Waia is related to the Pahoturi
	languages but adduces no evidence and there is certainly nothing obvious that
	links the two. Pronouns were not explicitly examined (and perhaps not implicitly
	either) by Ross **hh:hv:Ross:Pronouns** but, in any case, they do not match
	Pahoturi.
