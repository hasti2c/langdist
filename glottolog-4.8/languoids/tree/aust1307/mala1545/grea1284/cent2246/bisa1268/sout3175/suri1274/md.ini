comment = The Tandaganon language is distinct from Surigaonon and from other languages in
	northeastern Mindanao (Butuanon, Kamayo, Mamanwa, Manobo) and other Philippine
	languages. It was included in the Zorc dissertation/monograph on Bisayan
	languages, but overlooked by all other researchers afterwards (but will be
	included in the forthcoming Lobel dissertation, where it is treated a distinct
	language). Zorc's dissertation treats Tandaganon as coordinate with Surigaonon,
	as does the forthcoming Lobel dissertation. Native speakers of this language
	refer to it as "Tandaganon" or "Tagon-on" and not as Surigaonon. It is different
	enough from Surigaonon that Surigaonon speakers refer to it as "Kamayo" (which
	is the next language to the south of Tandaganon); On the other hand, it is
	different enough from Kamayo that Kamayo speakers refer to it as "Tandaganon",
	"Tagon- on", or "Surigaonon". Tandaganon speakers often have intelligibility of
	Surigaonon because Surigaonon speakers from northern Surigao del Sur often come
	to Tandag (the provincial capitol) in order to conduct business. Surigaonon
	speakers (and especially those from outside of Surigao del Sur province) have
	much less understanding of Tandaganon, and as previously stated, often
	mistakenly refer to it as "Kamayo", a language which is even more different from
	Surigaonon.
